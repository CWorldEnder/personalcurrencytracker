Tracks your personal made up currency; Can add/remove/check amount

# Changing the amount #
There are 2 ways to change the amount
1. Use the commands
   - ```::add x``` adds ```x``` coins to your balance
   - ```::remove x``` removes ```x``` coins from your balance
   - ```::set x``` sets your balance to ```x``` 
2. Change it manually through the Config Panel

# Checking the Amount #
1. Check the info panel if it is enabled
2. Use the command ```::count```

# Custom Coin Image #
To use a custom image, set the Coin Type option to `Custom` in the Config Panel, and place your image named ```coin.png``` in ```%userprofile%\.runelite``` on Windows or `~/.runelite/` on Linux/MacOS.

If this does not work, try renaming your coin image to just `coin`.
